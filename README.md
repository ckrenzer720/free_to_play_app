# FreeToPlay Game Explorer
Welcome to the FreeToPlay Game Explorer, one of my first web applications! ðŸŽ‰ This project is designed to help users discover and explore the best free-to-play games and MMO games programmatically using the comprehensive FreeToGame API. It's a simple yet powerful way to retrieve detailed game information, such as titles, genres, descriptions, and more.
